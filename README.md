# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of the Mission to Mars challenge was an exercise to create an application using Beautiful Soup, Chrome Driver Manager, Flask, MongoDB, Pandas and Splinter to scrape data from websites containing data on the Nasaâ€™s Mars Missions.  The application was setup to retrieve Mars data, parse the data, place the data into a Mongo database and output the most recent data to a website to be viewed.  The website was setup to update with new information via an update button. See clips of website below.
